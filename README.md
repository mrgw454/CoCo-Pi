# CoCo-Pi
CoCo-Pi Project

The CoCo-Pi project is based on work from many other projects and individuals. The sum of all the pieces became the Raspbian based Coco-Pi distribution for the RPi3, RPi4 & RPi400. This repo only includes scripts and/or configuration files at the moment, but this will allow for some very easy updating for bugs or enhancements.
